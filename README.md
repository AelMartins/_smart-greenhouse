# ABOUT OUR PROJECT

Name: _"Smart Greenhouse"_

Description: _"We aim to apply simplicity in planting small herbs with technology."_

Data to be collected:

- Light level
- Soil moisture
- Plant weight
- Ambient temperature

> [!NOTE]
> We will compare plant development data with an API that provides data on ideal environments for each type of plant.
