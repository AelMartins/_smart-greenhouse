# Security policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the project, we ask that you help us keep the community safe by following these steps:

1. **Do not disclose publicly**: Please do not create public issues for the vulnerability. Instead, email [oneapcwork@gmail.com].

2. **Provide details**: Include as much information about the vulnerability as possible. This may include a detailed description, steps to reproduce, or even example code. You can also use the standard issue rules in our documentation (ISSUE_TEMPLATE), if you like.

3. **Wait for a response**: You will receive a response as quickly as possible. We are committed to treating security vulnerabilities seriously and taking the necessary steps to correct them.

## Security Updates

Stay informed about project security updates. We recommend keeping an eye on the CHANGELOG document and details in commits about new versions.

## Appreciate

Thanks in advance for helping to make this project safer for everyone.
